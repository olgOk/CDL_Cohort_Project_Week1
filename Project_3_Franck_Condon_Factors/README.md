## Project 3: Franck-Condon Factors

This project will guide you through calculating Franck-Condon Factors, which is related to the intensities in spectra of vibrational transitions across electronic surfaces. Spectra can be measured through experiments, but having accurate theoretical calculations of these Franck-Condon Factors allow scientists to instead predict these experimental results. This is especially useful if the chemical species is expensive, difficult to acquire or difficult to study or if the experiment itself is expensive or difficult.

In our [Project3_LandingPage.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_3_Franck_Condon_Factors/Project3_LandingPage.pdf), we provide some basic information about the chemistry and physics behind these Franck-Condon Factors and we encourage you to explore more literature if interested! 

Open up [Project3_LandingPage.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_3_Franck_Condon_Factors/Project3_LandingPage.pdf) to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

## Tasks include:
* Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of molecular Hydrogen using a simple model
* Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of a more complex molecule (V<sub>3</sub>) using matrix elements
* Calculate the Franck-Condon Factors (and spectra) of that molecule using vibronic sampling. This calculation involves Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS), which would allow these factors to be calculated using a quantum circuit.

## Further Challenges:
* An alternative and analogous method to calculating these Franck-Condon Factors using matrix elements is to use a loop hafnian approach. This loop hafnian approach uses GBS which would allow these factors to be calculated using a quantum circuit. Use the result of Task 3 to provide data to a skeleton code provided that uses loop hafnians to calculate the Franck-Condon Factors.
* Explain briefly the similarities and differences between these three methods.

## Possible Business Outcomes:
* Explain to a layperson what theoretical chemistry/physics is, in the general context of Franck-Condon Factors
* What is the importance of theoretical chemistry/physics from an economic point of view
* Explain to a layperson what a quantum circuit is and it's relationship to theoretical chemistry/physics
* What are advantages and disadvantages of codes licensed for the public domain and those that are licensed for private use
